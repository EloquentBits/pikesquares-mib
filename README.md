# Mac OS Installer Builder (aka MIB)

## Usage

As simple as:

First of all, place your binary inside `_files/binary` directory and rename it according to user usage.
For example, if your built binary named `vconf-linux-x86_64`, the binary inside `_files/binary` directory should be called `vconf` as user should have run it after installation.

Then run installer script:
```bash
bash make-mac-installer.sh
```

Be sure, you're located in directory, where this script is placed!

If you named your config file `my-product.json`, and placed it into `/tmp/build` (for example) you can run mib like this:
```bash
bash make-mac-installer.sh -c /tmp/build/my-product.json
bash make-mac-installer.sh --config /tmp/build/my-product.json
```

Do not be scared, when it asked for password, the pkg installer (see `installer.check_after_build`) requires sudo for testing of successful package installation.

The built installer will be placed in this folder with the name you give it in config file
(see `installer.file_name`)
